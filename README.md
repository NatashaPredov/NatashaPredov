* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Based on a 2018 CNBC article, Chen wanted to create a product that enabled financial transparency with online services advice. He realized there was a need in the market for a product like this when he "received an email from his sister with a question about finding a credit card with lower foreign transaction fees" where to answer said financial question he proceeded to say 'Let me Google that for you'" Chen was then “shocked" as he was unable to "find anything on Google that wasn’t basically marketing [or] promotional material.” Chen then realized the customers had to shift through heavy banking material to receive answers to their questions. Thus the birth of Nerdwallet came to.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years? At one point, financial advisors (usually in person) were people that customers of Banks trusted most with the money or money decisions.  LPL Financial outlined that " We can trace the dawn of the true financial advisor back to the 1980s. That’s when private investors first had access to investment advice—rather than just someone to take their orders and execute stock trades." But there was a shift from selling Banking products to selling advice rooted in their experience and knowledge. Over the last 5 to 10 years with the boom of the internet, wireless telephone and mobile applications "Financial advisors are no longer the gatekeepers of information on stocks, market trends, and economic forecasts". Rather this information is avalible and accessible 24/7 by not only investors but customers themselves. This is where NerdWallet comes in. It fits within the domain or role of financial advisor but through an online medium.
